Dear Korey,
SDSC’s welcomes you to this years Summer Institute 2017: High Perfomance Computing and Data Science to be held at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) Auditorium on the campus of University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Monday, July 31 – Friday, August 4, 2017.  We are pleased you will be attending!

We wanted to make one last contact prior to your arrival. 

Please arrive in the SDSC Auditorium Monday at 8:00am for check-in.  SDSC Auditorium is located on the east side of the building on the ground floor just off the driveway.  Our building is a LEED certified building utilizing fresh air to cool the building.  Even in summer this can create a cooler room than usual so layers are suggested.  The Summer Institute runs the full week and we ask that you plan to attend in its entirety.

All participants:  You can plan on morning coffee and light snacks, lunch and afternoon light snacks each day.  We have scheduled two evening events following the program on Monday and Thursday.  Please plan to join the group for a reception on Monday evening at a beautiful property overlooking the pacific coastline.  Thursday we have a beach BBQ planned at one of our local beach spots, the La Jolla Shores Hotel, allowing you to enjoy the beach or sit down and enjoy a cold one.  San Diego and specifically the coastline can cool off quite a bit in the evenings so a sweater or light jacket is recommended.  Transportation will be provided to both events from SDSC. 

Let me refer you to the website for all details regarding the Summer Institute.
